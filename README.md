# GrimDarkSimulator

A comprehensive Warhammer 40k combat simulator written in Go that accurately models the complete combat sequence with detailed statistical analysis and granular combat logging.

## Features

### üéØ Complete Combat Resolution
- **Hit Phase**: Skill-based hit rolls (BS/WS) with modifier support
- **Wound Phase**: Strength vs Toughness matrix calculations
- **Save Phase**: Dual save system (Armor/Invulnerable) with AP modification
- **Damage Phase**: Variable damage application with model removal

### ‚öîÔ∏è Advanced Combat Mechanics
- **Critical Hits**: Rolls ‚â• CritHit modifier trigger special effects
- **Lethal Hits**: Critical hits auto-wound (bypass wound rolls)
- **Sustained Hits X**: Critical hits generate X additional hits
- **Devastating Wounds**: Critical wound rolls bypass all saves
- **Torrent Weapons**: Auto-hit weapons skip hit rolls entirely

### üîÑ Reroll Systems
- **Hit Rerolls**: Full rerolls or reroll 1s only
- **Wound Rerolls**: Full rerolls or reroll 1s only
- **Complete Transparency**: All original and reroll results logged

### üõ°Ô∏è Abilities System
The simulator automatically detects and applies unit abilities that modify combat characteristics:

#### Unit Abilities
- **Oath of Moment**: All weapons gain reroll hits capability
- **Stationary**: Heavy weapons receive +1 to hit modifier
- **Rapid Fire Distance**: Rapid Fire weapons gain additional attacks equal to their Rapid Fire value
- **Red Rampage**: Melee weapons gain both Lethal Hits and Lance abilities, but unit becomes Battle-shocked

#### Weapon Abilities
- **Twin-linked**: Weapons with "Twin-linked" in name or keywords gain reroll wounds
- **Heavy**: When combined with "Stationary" ability, gains +1 to hit
- **Rapid Fire X**: When combined with "Rapid Fire Distance" ability, gains X additional attacks

### üìä Statistical Analysis
- **100 Simulation Runs**: Comprehensive damage distribution
- **Percentile Analysis**: 68th and 95th percentile damage outputs
- **Realistic Results**: Balanced outcomes reflecting tabletop play

### üìù Granular Combat Logging
- **Phase-by-Phase Breakdown**: Every step of combat logged
- **Individual Dice Rolls**: All hit/wound/save rolls recorded
- **Special Rule Tracking**: Critical hits, rerolls, and abilities logged
- **Ability Applications**: All ability modifications logged with before/after values
- **Defender Status**: Remaining models and wounds after each attack
- **JSON Structured Logs**: Machine-readable combat data

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- Unit files in YAML format (from library_builder)

### Installation
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd GrimDarkSimulator
go mod tidy
```

### Running Simulations
```bash
go run .
```

## Unit File Format

Units are loaded from the `./library/` directory in YAML format:

```yaml
name: "Captain with Jump Pack"
type: "Character"
cost: 85
abilities:
  - "Leader"
  - "Deep Strike"
  - "Oath of Moment"  # Grants reroll hits to all weapons
keywords:
  - "Infantry"
  - "Character"
models:
  - name: "Captain with Jump Pack"
    count: 1
    stats:
      M: "12\""
      T: "4"
      SV: "3+"
      W: "5"
      LD: "6+"
      OC: "1"
    loadouts:
      "Master-crafted Power Weapon":
        name: "Master-crafted power weapon"
        type: "Melee Weapons"
        A: "5"
        WS: "2+"
        S: "5"

        AP: "1"
        D: "2"
        Keywords: "Heavy, Sustained Hits 1"  # Benefits from Stationary
```

## Combat Mechanics

### Hit Resolution
1. **Abilities Check**: Apply unit and weapon abilities that modify hit characteristics
2. **Skill Check**: Roll vs BS (ranged) or WS (melee)
3. **Critical Hits**: Rolls ‚â• CritHit value (default 6+)
4. **Special Rules**: 
   - Lethal Hits: Critical hits auto-wound
   - Sustained Hits X: Add X hits per critical
5. **Rerolls**: Apply hit rerolls if available

### Wound Resolution  
1. **S vs T Matrix**: Calculate wound threshold
   - S ‚â• 2√óT: 2+ to wound
   - S > T: 3+ to wound  
   - S = T: 4+ to wound
   - S < T: 5+ to wound
   - S ‚â§ T/2: 6+ to wound
2. **Devastating Wounds**: Critical wounds (6+ by default) bypass saves
3. **Lethal Hits**: Auto-wound without rolling
4. **Rerolls**: Apply wound rerolls if available

### Save Resolution
1. **Devastating Wounds**: Apply damage directly (no saves)
2. **Save Priority**: Invulnerable saves checked first
3. **AP Modification**: Armor saves modified by weapon AP
4. **Damage Application**: Failed saves apply weapon damage

### Abilities Processing
Abilities are automatically applied at the start of each combat sequence:

1. **Unit Abilities**: Processed first, affecting all applicable weapons
2. **Weapon Keywords**: Processed second, affecting specific weapons
3. **Logging**: All ability applications are logged with before/after values
4. **Stacking**: Multiple modifiers can stack (e.g., +1 hit from multiple sources)

## Abilities Reference

### Oath of Moment
- **Effect**: All weapons gain `RerollHits = true`
- **Application**: Applied to every weapon in every model's loadout
- **Usage**: Represents focused targeting and battle prayer benefits

### Stationary
- **Effect**: Heavy weapons gain `HitMod += 1` (+1 to hit)
- **Application**: Only affects weapons with "Heavy" keyword
- **Usage**: Represents the accuracy benefit of stationary firing positions

### Rapid Fire Distance
- **Effect**: Rapid Fire weapons gain additional attacks equal to their Rapid Fire value
- **Application**: Parses "Rapid Fire X" keywords and adds X to the weapon's attack count
- **Usage**: Represents double-tapping at close range

### Twin-linked
- **Effect**: Weapons gain `RerollWounds = true`
- **Application**: Affects weapons with "Twin-linked" in name or keywords
- **Usage**: Represents multiple barrels/enhanced targeting systems

## Configuration

Weapon modifiers can be configured in the unit YAML:

```yaml
# Weapon modifiers (set during unit loading)
Modifiers:
  RerollHits: false      # Reroll all failed hits
  RerollHit1s: false     # Reroll hit rolls of 1  
  RerollWounds: false    # Reroll all failed wounds
  RerollWound1s: false   # Reroll wound rolls of 1
  HitMod: 0             # Modifier to hit rolls (+/-)
  WoundMod: 0           # Modifier to wound rolls (+/-)
  CritHit: 6            # Critical hit threshold
  CritWound: 6          # Critical wound threshold
```

## Special Rules Implementation
